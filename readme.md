# The Rust Programming Language

Just a place for me to keep the coding examples I work on while I read "The Rust Programming Language" by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols

The book in its current form is [available here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

The book source is [available here](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/)

You can [buy a physical copy here](https://nostarch.com/Rust)


I am reading the thrid printing of the physical book copyright 2018.

My rust version at the time of this writing is

`rustc 1.43.0 (4fb7144ed 2020-04-20)`
